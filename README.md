# Evolving Shaders PVM tool

Evolving Shaders is a site to parse and mutate some fragment shader text.

It has been used to play and get some textures for pungas-attack, an interface for Buenos Aires Informatics Museum exposure and play on the nights :).

It has some limitations, for example:
  - About shader syntax.
  - About just mutating expressions AST nodes, no IF and FOR touched i.e.
  - Dependencies sometimes fail to pase some code (altough they are getting more mature).
